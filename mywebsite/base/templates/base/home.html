            <hr>
            <p>3 months after writing my first Hello World program on september 8th 2023 (While working in the marketing department)
                I had convinced my boss to let me stab at building a better version of the outdated laboratory managemnt system my company was running on.</p>
                <p>Before I knew it we transmitted from the old system and we're on to mine. My newbie self was now in charge of hosting hundreds of thousands of lab samples and supporting thousands of clients.</P>

                    <p>From this you'll see that I'm someone that jumps before I can talk myself out of doing somenthing scary.</p>
